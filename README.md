The "Devices/Detectors/Components Library" is a list containing all of the items in the laser-plasma laboratory that could be represented in a metadata system. Please make edits/comments where you see fit. 

Remember that the final organization of this data could change drastically, for example, we create a single container for "laser's pulse duration measurement" and all of the listed devices (Wizzler, FROG, SPIDER, etc.) get summarized somehow in that container.

Please feel free to read through and add to the Feedback section, including summarizing feedback from colleagues.

The document "HELPMI Common Phrases.odt" contains a list of just that, commonly used wording for the main document "HELPMI DDC Library.odt".

Categories left as template, left empty, or filled in by a NON-expert:

*     Streak Camera
*     Proton/Ion Spectrometer
*     FROG
*     Scintillator Screen
*     Temperature Sensor
*     Vibration Sensor
*     Humidty Sensor
*     Vacuum Sensor
*     Mechanical Shutter
*     Electro-Optical Shutter
*     Spectral Filter
*     Amplitude Filter
*     Beam Splitter
*     Generic Optic
*     Foil Target
*     Particle Beam Probe

All other categories can and should still be edited/commented, but the list above would definitely need work if those devices/items will be included.
